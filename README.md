# Data Visualization: Exploring with Seaborn
Final project for Data Visualization: Seaborn in Alura Courses

In this project it was made some analysis on a .csv database with some informations about tips.
We searched for a relation in bill value and tip fee.
Also looked for some day of the week or time of the day that people pays a higher tip fee.

# Method
For this analysis was used some Pandas and Seaborn Features.

# Analysis I
The relation between tips and bills.

## Results
It was possible to infere that the tips are directly linked with the total value of the bill.
The amout offed as tip is proportionally lowen in higher bills.

# Analysis II
The relation between tips and desserts orders.

## Results
It was possible to mathematically see that the dessert orders do not interefere in tips.

# Analysis III
The relation between day f the week and total value of the bill.

## Results
It was possible to mathematically see that people spend the same amount during the weekend (most active days).

# Analysis IV
The relation between Lunch/Dinner and value of the bill.

## Results
It was possible to mathematically see that people spend more money on dinner than lunch.
Also in hypothesis 2 we saw that it's not mathematically corret to say that besides that the tip distribution still the same.
